# CDs-Sample-Python-Code

My first repository for the GMIT Data Analytics course - samples of code I've got working. 

## Purpose of this Repository
The purpose of this repository is to collate samples of python code which can be reused, either directly, or as a guide.

### Note to self
I can *style this readme* by checking out [Mastering Markdown!](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
